Create an algorithm that calculates the number of liters of fuel used in a trip,
knowing that the car travels 12 km per liter. The user should be provided with the time spent on the trip,
their average speed, the distance traveled, and the number of liters used to make the trip.

Formula: distance = time x speed.
liters used = distance / 12.
