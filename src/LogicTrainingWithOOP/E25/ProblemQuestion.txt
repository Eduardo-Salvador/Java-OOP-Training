A company wants to control the temperature of several smart rooms.
Each room has sensors that report the current temperature, and a system must check whether it is within
the acceptable range.
If the temperature is above the maximum, the air conditioning must be turned on.
If it is below the minimum, the heater must be turned on.
Otherwise, nothing must be done.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Objective:
Create a system that:
Allows you to register rooms with:
Room name
Minimum allowed temperature
Maximum allowed temperature
Current temperature
Automatically checks whether the room needs heating, cooling, or is stable.
Display a report.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Technical requirements:
At least two classes:
Room → represents a room and its temperature control logic.
AirConditioningSystem → contains an array/list of rooms and generates the report.
Use encapsulation (private attributes and get/set).
The logic must be in a method within the Room class, called checkClimate().

Example of expected output
=== Climate Control ===
Room: Office 1
Current temperature: 29.5°C → Needs cooling (AC on)

Room: Meeting
Current temperature: 20.0°C → Stable

Room: Reception
Current temperature: 17.0°C → Needs heating (Heater on)

-------------------------------------------------------------

Challenge:
Add a static method countHeatedRooms() that tells how many rooms have the heater on.
Implement constructor overloading to allow creating a Room with only a name and limits,
and then set the current temperature.
