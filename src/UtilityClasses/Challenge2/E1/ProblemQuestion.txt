1. Invoice System
Create an Invoice class with:

number, issue date, total amount, due date

isVencida() method that checks if the invoice is overdue

calculateMulta(doublepercentagePerDay) method that returns the fine amount based on the number of days late

Throw a custom InvoiceVencidaException exception if you attempt to pay an overdue invoice
