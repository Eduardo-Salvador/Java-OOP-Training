Invoice System
Create an Invoice class with:
number, issue date, total amount, due date
isOverdue() method that checks if the invoice is overdue
calculateFine(doublepercentagePerDay) method that returns the fine amount based on the number of days late
Throw a custom InvoiceVencidaException exception if you attempt to pay an overdue invoice
